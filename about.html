  <p>Girlhood Redefined is a year-long self-initiated research, art, and design project by Avrie Allen in collaboration with the Kinsey Institute as a part of an art + design internship funded through the Cox Scholars Program. The project will be exhibited March 22-April 20, 2024 in the Tangent Gallery at Indiana University and seeks to showcase the multiplicity of girlhood. Here, girlhood is not limited to cis experiences of girlhood or requires one to currently identify as a girl or woman. Anyone who has experienced girlhood, in its many forms, is invited to participate.
