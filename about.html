    <p class="black">Girlhood Redefined is an open-ended web archive and exhibition project by Avrie Allen. Girlhood Redefined not only seeks to showcase the multiplicity of girlhood, but is an attempt to think through what it means to create knowledge and collective subjectivity from a feminist perspective. Here, girlhood is not limited to cis experiences of girlhood or requires one to currently identify as a girl or woman. Anyone who has experienced girlhood in its many forms is invited to participate and add to the archive.<br><br>
      The project will be exhibited March 22-April 20, 2024 in the Tangent Gallery at Indiana University.

      <span class="pink">Background</span>
      <br><br>
This project began as an open-ended exploration of girlhood as an ideology utilizing materials within Kinsey Instituteâ€™s art and library collections. Early on, I came across the book <em>Perfect Girlhood</em> that majorly influenced this project. Such sex education guides in the institute's collections, including <em>Perfect Girlhood, the Problems of Girlhood,</em> and <em>What Every Girl Needs to Know</em>, would have been found in the home for parents to teach their children. Their influence was very widespread and contributed to societal ideas of how a girl should behave and constructed norms of what constituted ideal girlhood in the early 20th century. The foundations of hegemonic understandings of girlhood have excluded girls and their experiences, as these guides were predominantly written by Euro-American men. In addition to heterosexist beliefs, Eugenics and racism inform the ideal girl within these guides. 
<br><br>
Unsurprisingly, the understandings of girlhood proposed within these books do not match how girls actually think about themselves. Nor do they account for the hardships and violence girls often experience. I wanted to create a space for the exploration of girlhood and forced binary gender in the terms of those who have experienced it. 
I argue that anyone who reflects on their practical experience is an intellectual, a creator of knowledge, and that feminists should take it upon themselves to gather knowledge and coalesce these experiences into new narratives of understanding. The resultant work is a feminist production of knowledge that contests the ideals found in the 20th century guides that inspired this project, the basis from which girlhood is redefined. This site exists within the lineage of feminist scholarship and practice, such as the organization of consciousness-raising groups, that utilize self-reflection and personal experience as subjective source material for objective knowledge creation, and ultimately action. Within this lineage, the resultant understanding is created from a dynamic, bottom-up approach, as opposed to the didactic, top-down mandate of the guides.
<br><br>There is a multiplicity of ways one can experience girlhood, though much of our experience is the same. Only by translating across the multiple ways of experiencing girlhood can feminists have a basis for the creation of more inclusive, uniting, and empowering knowledge of what it means to be a girl. This archive is just a first step.</span>
