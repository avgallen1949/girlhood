    <p class="black">Girlhood Redefined is a web archive and exhibition project by Avrie Allen in partnership with the Kinsey Institute. Girlhood Redefined not only seeks to showcase the multiplicity of girlhood, but is an attempt to think through what it means to create knowledge and collective subjectivity from a feminist perspective. Here, girlhood is not limited to cis experiences of girlhood or requires one to currently identify as a girl or woman. Anyone who has experienced girlhood in its many forms is invited to participate and add to the archive.<br><br>
      The project will be exhibited March 22-April 20, 2024 in the Tangent Gallery at Indiana University. Come to the reception / closing celebration on April 19 from 6-8 p.m. The gallery is located on the first floor of the Fine Arts Building next to the Grunwald Gallery.

      <span class="pink">Background</span>
      <br><br>
      Girlhood Redefined began as an open-ended exploration of the Kinsey Institute’s collections. Previously, I have created work on teenage girlhood and wanted to see what materials around girlhood the Kinsey Institute had to offer. I was immediately given the recommendation to look at Perfect Girlhood: Vital Information for Young Girls by TW Shannon. Perfect Girlhood is a moral / sex education book from the early 1900s that offered parents, specifically mothers, information on the morals and behaviors of an ideal girl. Such sex education books were used within the household to educate not only the adolescents whom the books were about, but also the adults reading them. Perfect Girlhood and other 20th century sex education books published in the U.S. within KI’s collection were largely not based in science. Rather, these books were concerned with constructing ideal girlhood within an oppressive context, wherein girls are encouraged to serve their families, the Christian God, and the nation with little regard for their own desires. Beyond heterosexist beliefs, Eugenics and racism also informed the ideal girl within these guides. This project is a direct response to these sex education guides. <br><br>
      These books had widespread influence as the primary resource for sex education at the time, and represent the ideological foundations of the commonplace understanding of girlhood in the United States today. Though their influence has been widespread, unsurprisingly, the understandings of girlhood proposed within these books do not match how girls actually think about themselves. Nor do they account for the hardships and violence girls often experience. I wanted to create a space for the exploration of girlhood and forced binary gender in the terms of those who have experienced it. I promote the idea that anyone who reflects on their practical experience is an intellectual, a creator of knowledge, and that feminists should take it upon themselves to gather knowledge and coalesce these experiences into new narratives of understanding.
<br><br>There is a multiplicity of ways one can experience girlhood, though much of our experience is the same. Only by translating across the multiple ways of experiencing girlhood can feminists have a basis for the creation of more inclusive, uniting, and empowering knowledge of what it means to be a girl. This archive is just a first step.</span>
