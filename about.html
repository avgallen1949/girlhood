    <span class="black">Girlhood Redefined is a year-long self-initiated research, art, and design project by Avrie Allen in collaboration with the Kinsey Institute as a part of an art + design internship funded through the Cox Scholars Program. The project will be exhibited March 22-April 20, 2024 in the Tangent Gallery at Indiana University and seeks to showcase the multiplicity of girlhood. Here, girlhood is not limited to cis experiences of girlhood or requires one to currently identify as a girl or woman. Anyone who has experienced girlhood, in its many forms, is invited to participate.

      <span class="pink">Background</span>
      <br><br>
This project began as an open-ended investigation into the topic of girlhood within Kinsey Institute’s library collection. Educational guides found in the Kinsey Institute library, such as <em>Perfect Girlhood, the Problems of Girlhood,</em> and <em>What Every Girl Needs to Know,</em> were very influential and contributed to societal ideas of how a girl should behave and constructed norms of what constituted ideal girlhood in the early 20th century. The foundations of hegemonic understandings of girlhood have excluded girls and their experiences, as these guides were predominantly written by Euro-American men. In addition to heterosexist beliefs, Eugenics and racism inform the ideal girl within these guides. The guides demonstrate the inseparability of sexism and racism in the production of ideal girlhood that still plagues predominant beliefs today.

<br><br>Some authors such as Winfield Scott Hall, author of <em>Girlhood and its Problems</em>, were explicit in their intentions to propagandize through their books. Hall wrote that  “It is necessary that the education, the rational prophylaxis of the evil, be begun in youth.” To Hall, evil was anything that was not heterosexual, chaste, and patriarchal. I found this particularly interesting amidst a heightening conservative panic around queer and non-normative gender identification and sexuality. These books illuminate the shortsightedness and the lack of historicity (which is obviously not the point of their claims) in conservative panic and false accusations of gender indoctrination by LGBT+ communities. This panic obscures the century+ long effort to explicitly proliferate, propagandize around, and (oftentimes violently) enforce heterosexism and the gender binary. It also obscures the fact that straight white men have been the primary enforcers of gender ideology. 

<br><br>Additionally, the understandings of girlhood proposed within these books (think sugar spice, everything nice) do not match how girls actually think about themselves. Nor do they account for the hardships and violence girls often experience. I wanted to create a space for the exploration of girlhood and forced binary gender in the terms of those who have experienced it. 
I argue that “anyone who reflects on thier practical experience is an intellectual, a creator of knowledge,” and that feminists should take it upon themselves to gather knowledge and coalesce these experiences into new narratives of understanding. The resultant work is a feminist production of knowledge that contests the ideals found in the 20th century guides that inspired this project, the basis from which girlhood is redefined. My work exists as part of the lineage of feminist scholarship and practice, such as the organization of consciousness-raising groups, that utilize self-reflection and personal experience as subjective source material for objective knowledge creation. Within this lineage, the resultant definitions are created from a dynamic, bottom-up approach, as opposed to the oppressive, top-down mandate of the guides.
<br><br>There is a multiplicity of girlhoods, though we share many of the same experiences. Only by translating across the multiple ways of experiencing girlhood can feminists have a basis for the creation of more inclusive, uniting, and empowering knowledge of what it means to be a girl. This archive is just a first step.</span>
